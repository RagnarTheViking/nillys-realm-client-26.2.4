test.nillysrealm.com build 26.2.4 converted to AS3 Client

Compilable [V]
Playable [ ]
Leecahble From [V]

Search for SEEMELATER to see what I didn't catch on. :) Or what I commented out because I didn't know what it was.

You need the FLEX SDK to compile this.

This client is not my work, I've only build a flash project from it. :) Took a while but I believe it was worth it after all. Not really.

This client can be used with other sources if you modify it, search up SEEMELATER to see anything you have to fix, everything that I did wrong, I commented out with the tag SEEMELATER.

This is just something to start off with.

Fonts need to be added, I only fixed the errors, didn't add anything else. (I will add the fonts in when I get some free time)
